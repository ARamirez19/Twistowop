  Description: 'Asset Hunter is THE project cleaning tool of the asset store.


    It helps you locate all the unused asset and delete them. It will reduce time
    spend waiting for the editor to load, it also simply boosts productivity in general
    by having to search through less stuff.


    Quick start:

    1: Open Asset Hunter PRO (Ctrl+H)

    2: Create a build

    3: Load newly created log into Asset Hunter PRO

    4: Inspect and delete unused assets

    5: Use settings to ignore certain types, folders etc.


    On the roadmap:

    Information on added assemblies [DONE]

    Improved unused script detection

    Buildinfo comparison

    Asset Dependency graph
